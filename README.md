# Wagtail public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Wagtail public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wagtail/projects/16).

Our public roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. It also covers major community or project efforts that aren’t features.

We’re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of Wagtail. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [GitHub Discussions for Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is a GitHub issue, with [labels](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/labels) to indicate high-level areas of focus.

### What goes on the roadmap

Only items of significant interest to the community go onto the roadmap. This definition is purposefully vague at the moment, and should be reviewed on a regular basis.

Items only go onto the roadmap once they have been considered by the core team. These items might, or might not need an RFC for implementation details before they get on the roadmap.

### Roadmap lifecycle

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every project or feature is added to a particular board column according to the release in which it is expected to be done. Items spanning multiple releases / long-term architecture changes can have a dedicated column. Items without any agreed delivery mechanism go into a "Future" column. This Future column acts as a way to attract contributions and/or sponsorship on items that align with our long-term plans.

Once an item is delivered we remove it from the board - the release notes act as the record of its delivery.
